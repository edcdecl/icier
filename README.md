icier is an unbelievably fast and correct x86 (16/32/64-bit) instruction disassembler and assembler.

- üëç Supports almost all Intel and AMD instructions (including undocumented ones!).
- üëç Tested and fuzzed against other disassemblers/assemblers (xed, gas, objdump, masm, dumpbin, nasm, ndisasm).
- üëç Supports MASM, NASM, GAS, and Intel formatting, with the option of a custom formatter as well.
- üëç Stupid fast: Decodes >250 MB/s and decode+format >130 MB/s (Rust, [see here](https://github.com/icedland/disas-bench/tree/a865849deacfb6c33ee0e78f3a3ad7f4c82099f5#results)).
- üëç The encoder can be used to re-encode decoded instructions at any address.
- üëç API to get instruction info, eg. read/written registers, memory and rflags bits; CPUID feature flag, control flow info, etc.
